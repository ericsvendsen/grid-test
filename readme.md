#Angular UI Grid Test
* git clone
* npm install
* bower install
* run `gulp`

## The Problem
When hovering over the grid, a user is unable to scroll down on the page. Trackpads work, but a mouse with a scrollwheel does not. See [this Github issue](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-grid/issues/1926) for more information.
